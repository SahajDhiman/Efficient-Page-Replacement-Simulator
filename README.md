# Efficient-Page-Replacement-Simulator
The project “Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator” is designed to demonstrate how operating systems manage memory using different page replacement algorithms. It focuses on three major algorithms — FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal Page Replacement.
